			<p>I have many years of experience in editorial and web production.</p>

			<p>I translate between English, Maltese and Italian. To a lesser extent, I can also handle French, German and basic phrases in Arabic.</p>

			<p>I’ve lived in Malta, London and Berlin, and I’m now based in Brussels. In London, I worked in editorial roles with Vogue, The Modern Review, and for five years I was the editor of GSpot Magazine. I also wrote for several publications, including The Face, Dazed & Confused and The Guardian.</p>

			<p>I’m available for freelance editorial or web-development work. I have experience in editing academic work, final papers, proposals, etc. I can do light design work, as well as audio and video editing. Contact me on <a class="email" href="mailto:work@joegatt.net">work@joegatt.net</a>.</p>

			<p>More recently, my work been published in <a href="https://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/stock/scintillas-new-maltese-writing-1-various">Scintillas 1 (Praspar Press 2022)</a> and <a href="https://thelondonmagazine.org/fiction-under-the-sun-by-joe-gatt/">The London Magazine</a>. You can also read some of my writing in English at <a href="https://joegattnet.substack.com">joegattnet.substack.com</a> and <a href="https://joegatt.net">joegatt.net</a>, and in Maltese at <a href="https://aphroconfuso.mt/joe-gatt/">Aphroconfuso</a>.</p>

			<p>Later, while still in London, I developed websites with the BBC, the BBC World Service, Shazam, and the British Council.</p>

			<p>I am co-founder and co-editor of the Maltese-language literary journal <a href="https://aphroconfuso.mt/joe-gatt/">Aphroconfuso</a>, launched on 1 May 2023. Besides the work I do on the editorial side, I also built the website and back-end to support it, using Eleventy and Strapy&nbsp;<aside class="asterisk">*</aside></p>
