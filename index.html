		<header><h1>Joe Gatt</h1></header>
		<main>

			<p>I’ve lived in Malta, London and Berlin, and I’m now based in Brussels. </p>

			<p>I have many years of experience in editorial and web production.</p>

			<p>I can translate between English, Maltese and Italian; I have translated from Italian into both Maltese and English in a literary context. To a lesser extent, I can also handle French, German and basic words or phrases in Arabic.</p>

			<p>My stories have been published in Scintillas 1 (Praspar Press) and The London Magazine.</p>

			<p>You can read some of my writing in English at joegattnet.substack.com and in Maltese at Aphroconfuso.</p>

			<p>In London, I worked in editorial roles with Vogue, The Modern Review, and for five years I was the editor of GSpot Magazine. I also wrote for several publications, including The Face, Dazed & Confused and The Guardian.</p>

			<p>Later, while still in London, Joe worked on building websites with the BBC, the BBC World Service, Shazam, and the British Council.</p>

			<p>I am co-founder and co-editor of the Maltese-language literary journal Aphroconfuso, launched on 1 May 2023. Besides the work I do on the editorial side, I also built the website and back-end to support it, using Eleventy and Strapy.</p>

			<p>I’m available for freelance editorial or web-development work. I have experience in editing academic work, final papers, proposals, etc. I can do light design work, as well as audio and video editing. Contact me on <a href="mailto:work@joegatt.net">work@joegatt.net</a></p>
